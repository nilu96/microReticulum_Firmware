// Native-target KISS-over-TCP transport. A single-client TCP server bound
// to 127.0.0.1, replacing the embedded firmware's USB-serial KISS channel
// on Portduino-backed builds.
//
// Lifecycle mirrors Remote.h's WiFiServer pattern: one listening socket,
// at most one active client, idle-timeout-driven reconnect. Second clients
// are rejected immediately by accepting + close()ing them on the spot.
//
// Logs (RNS log callback, printf redirect) DO NOT pass through this
// channel. They stay on Portduino's Serial (typically stdout). This keeps
// the KISS byte stream clean of ASCII log content.
